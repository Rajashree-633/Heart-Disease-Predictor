# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various health indicators such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, and maximum heart rate.  It  uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
